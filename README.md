<h1>Customizable-Inventory-Management-Software</h1>

The project is a modern, stylish and interactive web application where the customers can place orders on the OEM (Car accessories manufacturer in this scenario) and the employees can manage stock – all by using a few clicks. This saves the tedious task of manually handling large databases, thereby improving the productivity of employees as well as production efficiency of the company by providing real-time availability of the materials. 

The project aims to provide a convenient solution for its users wherein using different profiles/login IDs, one can perform various tasks according to their respective roles
For example, users (here, from Car Manufacturing companies) can check the availability and place the purchase orders on the OEM/supplier of Cars’ electrical cabling and plastic accessories. Users can get the details about their orders almost instantly without any manual intervention of the OEM/supplier’s personnel. 
On the other hand, employees (OEM/Supplier) can login to the portal with their unique IDs and can do a wide range of tasks like placing orders on behalf of their customers, checking the availability of materials, updating stock, updating price or adding new product range.
This will save a lot of time for both, the customers and the OEM as it helps them to manage their order details and availability of stock at a single panel and almost instantly. This will also help OEMs to flourish their trade by efficient management of the saleable inventory.  
Thus, the software provides a convenient and hassle-free solution for its users
